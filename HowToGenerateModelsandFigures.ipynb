    "There are several steps required to create models and to re-create the figures and they should be run in the order indicated as each step creates files that are required for the next. \n",

    "1. Use the Network.py code to train a network with your desired specifications. This will generate a file named by the configuration selected that will contain both the initialized weights as well as the trained weights and final accuracies over training epochs. By default the model will train for 100 epochs on the sMNIST data set, unless --nepochs n option is set.  Networks can have any of a number of configurations ex; \n",
